      <p class="lead">A reflection on the purpose of reading and how books shape our lives.</p>

      <p>Reading is more than just collecting information â€” it is a way of shaping our minds, expanding our empathy, and finding meaning in the world. Books allow us to live many lives, experience new perspectives, and refine our own thoughts.</p>

      <p>When we read, we are not only absorbing knowledge but also engaging in a dialogue with history, culture, and philosophy. Every page adds a subtle layer to how we understand ourselves and the world.</p>

      <h2>The Deeper Purpose</h2>
      <p>At its best, reading helps us slow down. In a world rushing with notifications and distractions, a book insists on patience and attention. This is not an escape from reality â€” it is a deeper encounter with it.</p>

      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Why do we read? Perhaps because life is short, but the ideas we inherit and share through books are timeless.</p>
